# Autocomplete Texts

MDCExt Autocomplete provides Material Design single-option and multi-option autocomplete texts. It functions analogously to the
browser's native `<select>` element, and includes a gracefully degraded version that can be used
in conjunction with the browser's native element. Both are fully accessible, and fully RTL-aware.

## Installation

```
npm install --save @mdcext/autocomplete
```
